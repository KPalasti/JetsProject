## What I learned
I learned how to better understand the concept of instantiation and calling non-static methods across files. I still have difficulty fully wrapping my head around it but I think I have gotten a lot closer to a stronger understanding. I worked more with ArrayLists but I think I need more practice with that as well. However, I am happy that I made a lot of progress with and without my tutors and colleagues in the class. It was difficult but I am glad that I made it before the deadline.
